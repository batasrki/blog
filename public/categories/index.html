        Implementing a queue using an array

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Up tonight, I&rsquo;m going to write a queue implementation using a vector in Clojure and a fixed-size array in Go. The reason for the latter is that the Data Structures course on Coursera shows an interesting way of making a queue work when the backing data structure is of fixed size.
Essentially, what I will do is implement a circular buffer. As items are popped off the front of the queue to be worked on, I&rsquo;ll have two pointers that will wrap around to the beginning of the array as needed.

      Following on from the last post, tonight I am going to try and implement the stack using a linked list instead of an array.
Short background As explained in the course, a linked list might be preferred over an array, because in languages like C, an array has to be of fixed size. Adding a one more element to a full stack will cause an overflow error at best and overwrite random memory addresses at worst.

First up, I&rsquo;d like to attempt to implement a stack in Clojure and Ruby using an array as the base data structure.

      Tonight, I will start on enabling deletion of links in my ReactJS single-page app. It should be straightforward, but with new tech, you just never know.
Client-side first On the client-side, I need add a small form that will submit the DELETE request to the server using the given ID. The most logical place for the markup is on the component, but I suspect that I&rsquo;ll need to pass the event up to the root component in order to keep the one-way data flow and easy re-rendering.

The course wants me to use Scala and Kompics (course facilitators&rsquo; distributed framework thing). I really don&rsquo;t have an interest in Scala, and I&rsquo;m auditing the course so I can&rsquo;t submit work anyway. I thought it&rsquo;d be interesting to use Elixir and OTP to solve the problems.

      A different tack I&rsquo;ve been very lucky to have had steady employment using Ruby and Rails. At times, it felt like cheating. How can I have so much fun and get paid well for it?

      Introduction Up tonight, I’ll explore enhancing the querying in my app with the use of Riak Search. Basho has recently added a list-keys warning to the Ruby driver and all of my current MapReduce code is triggering it. Riak Search should help there by enabling me to reduce the set of keys in the events bucket to the ones closer to what I’m looking. Since that won’t traverse the entire bucket, I’ll avoid triggering the warning.

      Intro In the previous post, I briefly introduced CRDTs in Ruby and have shown a basic usage case for one Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type. Tonight, we will explore one slightly more complicated use case that can be seen in real applications in the wild.
Use case For the purpose of this post, imagine we&rsquo;re running a Netflix clone. We have accounts and we have movies. For the purposes of recommendations, we want to store what movies each account holder has viewed.

      Introduction In this post, I shall attempt how to use CRDTs in a Ruby class, backed by the Riak database. CRDT stands for Commutative Replicated Data Type. There is no Wikipedia entry for this, yet, so I&rsquo;m linking to a blog post which is linking to a paper.
Background CRDTs solve a particular problem well. In a distributed database, like Riak, it is quite possible for a value under a key to receive multiple writes from different clients.

      tl; dr; Creating a Riak cluster as a set of nodes through Vagrant and talking to the cluster through the official Ruby driver turned out to be harder than expected. Cryptic errors in Riak itself and lack of documentation for hooking up the driver to the cluster were two root causes. The final, working versions of the Vagrantfile and the Riak config files needed to get things working are below.

      Background At my current job, I have been working on merchants stores&rsquo; integration with third parties. As a part of this task, I found that I needed to ensure that our app batches API calls to the third party. After doing a quick measurement, I found that batching API calls lowered the processing time by about 2x-5x when compared to doing the same calls in sequential order. However, whereas sequential processing had a clear approach of dealing with successful and failed calls, the batch call had none of that.

      This will be a quick post that documents an interesting find in RSpec.
Background I encountered a classic Ruby testing failure. I have an object whose method takes 2 time values, a start datetime and an end datetime. The intent of the method is to find records matching those values and send an e-mail to a related User account.
As many experienced Ruby programmers have seen, the failure looks like this:
