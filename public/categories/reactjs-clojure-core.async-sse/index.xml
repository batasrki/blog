      <description>Previously in Experiments, part 7,&amp;hellip; I switched from Compojure to Pedestal in order to take advantage of its support for Server-sent Events. I want to use that to send background updates to the client on completion of a task.
This took a while I expected this feature to be done very quickly. Up to now, every library I had to integrate into my app did so nearly seamlessly. It was a matter of reading the appropriate section of the library&amp;rsquo;s documentation, doing a few REPL experiments, integrating the code and doing manual testing.</description>
