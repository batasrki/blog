      <description>Previously in Experiments, part 3,&amp;hellip; I set up a card-based UI and added a few more records to my test data set.
In tonight&amp;rsquo;s installment&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s still (mostly) about the UI. I&amp;rsquo;m going to create a form for adding new links. I will be appending the links to the test data set and push dealing with the DB until later.
Onward, then&amp;hellip; Up to now, this has been a read-only app.</description>

      <description>Previously in Experiments, part 2,&amp;hellip; I set up dummy data on the backend, then created the initial set of components on the front end that consume that data.
In tonight&amp;rsquo;s installment&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s all about the UI. I&amp;rsquo;m going to add a few more links to the dummy set, then set up my card-based UI.
Onward, then&amp;hellip; Firstly, I&amp;rsquo;m going to add 3 more links to my dataset so that I can play with the layout.</description>

      <description>A different tack I&amp;rsquo;ve been very lucky to have had steady employment using Ruby and Rails. At times, it felt like cheating. How can I have so much fun and get paid well for it?
Continuing my search for that fun high, I started looking at other technologies. I&amp;rsquo;ve been an admirer of Clojure for a while. Its approach to composing programs seems to suit how I think software development should be.</description>
