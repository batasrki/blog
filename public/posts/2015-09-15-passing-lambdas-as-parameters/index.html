<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>At <a href="https://shopify.com">my current job</a>, I have been working on merchants stores&rsquo; integration with third parties. As a part of this task, I found that I needed to ensure that our app batches API calls to the third party. After doing a quick measurement, I found that batching API calls lowered the processing time by about 2x-5x when compared to doing the same calls in sequential order. However, whereas sequential processing had a clear approach of dealing with successful and failed calls, the batch call had none of that.</p>

<h2 id="lambdas">Lambdas</h2>

<p>The answer was suggested by my team lead and clarified by a co-worker. I then remembered I knew this about Ruby and I&rsquo;ve been using a similar approach extensively when writing Clojure programs.</p>

<p>Much like JS, Ruby allows us to pass a <code>lambda</code> or a <code>Proc</code> into a method as a parameter. We can then call this stored function with certain parameters. In the case above, what I wanted was to partition the responses to batched API calls into successful and failed ones. I could then invoke 2 lambdas, one for each set of responses and do the appropriate thing.</p>

<h2 id="a-trivial-example">A trivial example</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to share the code specific to my problem, so here&rsquo;s a trivialized version of the same approach:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">for_evens = lambda { |evens| p &quot;All even numbers in the set are: #{evens}&quot; }

for_odds = lambda { |odds| p &quot;All odd numbers in the set are: #{odds}&quot; }

the_set = (1..10).to_a

def partition_set_and_invoke_lambdas(the_set, for_evens, for_odds)
  evens, odds = the_set.partition {|item| item % 2 == 0}

  for_evens.call(evens)
  for_odds.call(odds)
end

partition_set_and_invoke_lambdas(the_set, for_odds, for_evens)

&quot;All odd numbers in the set are: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]&quot;
&quot;All even numbers in the set are: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]&quot;
 =&gt; &quot;All even numbers in the set are: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Cool, eh?</p>
