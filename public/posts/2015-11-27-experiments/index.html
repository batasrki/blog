<h2 id="a-different-tack">A different tack</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been very lucky to have had steady employment using Ruby and Rails. At times, it felt like cheating. How can I have so much fun and get paid well for it?</p>

<p>Continuing my search for that fun high, I started looking at other technologies. I&rsquo;ve been an admirer of Clojure for a while. Its approach to composing programs seems to suit how I think software development should be. In the same vein, ReactJS&rsquo;s approach to building UIs using components fits how I think UIs should be built. As such, I&rsquo;m embarking on a rewrite of my bookmarking site, <a href="http://particletransporter.io">Particle Transporter</a>, using Clojure and ReactJS.</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<p>The big goals for this rewrite are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Have a nicer UI for the listing of links than what&rsquo;s on the current site</li>
<li>Implement a filter (filter by tags to start with)</li>
<li>Fetch the title of a given link in the background using core.async</li>
<li>Fetch the first paragraph (if available) of a given link in the background using core.async</li>
<li>Have an offline mode, to ease development from multiple machines</li>
</ol>

<p>Having spent a few months at Shopify, I really started liking a UI concept called <a href="http://semantic-ui.com/views/card.html">Cards</a>. It seems to nicely encapsulate a piece of data. This makes it an easy choice for ReactJS, since we can take each saved link and all its data and metadata and wrap it into a card. However, I&rsquo;m getting ahead of myself. Firstly, I&rsquo;m going to set up the environment in which I can create this app.</p>

<p>##Setup</p>

<p>Since this will be a Clojure app, I&rsquo;m going to use <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/compojure">Compojure</a> as the base. Leiningen is a must, obviously, and it provides a template that generates a Compojure-flavoured skeleton.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ lein new compojure read-later
$ cd read-later &amp;&amp; ls
</code></pre>

<p>Cool, the filesystem structure is there. I am going to give it a quick whirl, running <code>lein ring server</code> on the command line within the directory. A few seconds later, I see &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; in a browser tab.</p>

<p>Now that I have a running server, I&rsquo;m going to add a view that sets up the skeleton of the html page. To do that, I&rsquo;ll install <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup">Hiccup</a>. It allows me to write views in Clojure, which will then render HTML. Stopping and starting the server using <code>lein</code> will install the newly specified dependency automatically.</p>

<p>OK, next, I need to add the base view and add ReactJS files.</p>

<pre><code class="language-clojure">(ns blog-post-app.views
  (:require [hiccup.page :refer [html5 include-js include-css]]))

(defn base-page [title &amp; body]
  (html5
   [:head
    (include-css &quot;https://cdn.rawgit.com/twbs/bootstrap/v4-dev/dist/css/bootstrap.css&quot;)
    [:title title]]
   [:body
    [:div.container-fluid
     [:h1
      [:a {:class :brand :href &quot;/&quot;} &quot;Particle Transporter Reborn&quot;]]
     [:div {:id &quot;content&quot;}]]
    (include-js &quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/0.14.3/react.js&quot;)
    (include-js &quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/0.14.3/react-dom.js&quot;)
    (include-js &quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-core/5.8.23/browser.min.js&quot;)
    (include-js &quot;https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js&quot;)
    (include-js &quot;/js/core.js&quot;)]))

(defn index []
  (base-page
      &quot;Saved Links - fPT&quot;))
</code></pre>

<p>I am going to reference the views file in the default <code>handler.clj</code> file and adjust the home route to render the HTML page.</p>

<pre><code class="language-clojure">(ns blog-post-app.handler
  (:require [compojure.core :refer :all]
            [compojure.route :as route]
            [blog-post-app.views :as views]
            [ring.middleware.defaults :refer [wrap-defaults site-defaults]]))

(defroutes app-routes
  (GET &quot;/&quot; []
       (views/index))
  (route/not-found &quot;Not Found&quot;))

(def app
  (wrap-defaults app-routes site-defaults))
</code></pre>

<p>Refreshing the page, I see the header link and an empty page. Checking the console, I see no errors, so all the JS files have been required successfully. Onto the next step, creating a ReactJS view.</p>

<h2 id="reactjs-view">ReactJS view</h2>

<p>The JavaScript file is straightforward to begin with.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">var LinkListContainer = React.createClass({
  render: function() {
    return (
      &lt;section className=&quot;linkListContainer&quot;&gt;
        &lt;LinkList data = {this.state.data} /&gt;
      &lt;/section&gt;
    );
  }
});

ReactDOM.render(&lt;LinkListContainer url=&quot;/api/links&quot; /&gt;, document.getElementById(&quot;content&quot;));
</code></pre>

<p>I specified the top-level component and the child component that will do most of the work. The top-level component is given a URL from which data will be fetched and an HTML element that it should render into.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for part 1. Next, I will specify the data source and render out the links.</p>
