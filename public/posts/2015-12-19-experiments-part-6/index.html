<p>I added a synchronous way of fetching a title from an HTML page, using Enlive.</p>

<h2 id="let-s-async-this-thing">Let&rsquo;s async this thing</h2>

<p>OK, I want to get the quick response back, but still keep this new functionality. This is where I introduce <code>core.async</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-clojure">;; in project.clj
[org.clojure/core.async &quot;0.2.374&quot;]

;; in handler.clj's require
(:require [clojure.core.async :as async :refer [&gt;! &lt; ! chan go]])
</code></pre>

<p>This library is based on concepts presented in a book called <a href="http://www.usingcsp.com/cspbook.pdf">Communicating Sequential Processes</a>. The core premise is that certain types of tasks can be handed off to a different process/thread, much like how web developers use background queues to do tasks like sending e-mail, etc. The beautiful thing about Clojure&rsquo;s implementation is that it&rsquo;s just a set of macros around core language features. That book is really worth reading. I am saying that more to myself than anyone else reading this.</p>

<p>Using this library, I am going to set up a pipeline that does the synchronous fetch-and-parse in an asynchronous way. For that, I need to set up 2 channels and a few functions that put values and take values from the channel and update things in the background.</p>

<pre><code class="language-clojure">(def request-chan (chan))
(def title-chan (chan))

(defn update-title [data record]
  (map #(if (= (:id record) (:id %))
          (assoc % :title (:title record))
          %) data))

(defn update-atom []
  (go
   (let [record (&lt; ! title-chan)]
     (println &quot;Got title&quot; (:title record))
     (println &quot;Updating the atom&quot;)
     (swap! links update-title record))))

(defn async-get-title []
  (go
   (let [record (&lt; ! request-chan)]
     (println &quot;Got the request, processing....&quot;)
     (&gt;! title-chan (assoc record :title (get-title (:url record)))))))

(defn async-request-title [new-link]
  (go
   (println &quot;Putting the request on channel&quot;)
   (&gt;! request-chan new-link)))
</code></pre>

<p>Reading from the bottom up, the code does the following steps.</p>

<ol>
<li>Put the newly created link record to the <code>request-chan</code> channel</li>
<li>Take the record off the <code>request-chan</code> channel, fetch the title from the HTML page, put the update onto <code>title-chan</code> channel</li>
<li>Take the updated record of <code>title-chan</code> channel, update the <code>links</code> atom.</li>
</ol>

<p>Because the update is done in the background, I won&rsquo;t see the effect until server reload, but that&rsquo;s fine for now. I have plans for that (did someone say <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events">Server-sent Events</a>). Programming can be so much fun, sometimes.</p>

<p>I want to explain the <code>update-title</code> function before moving on, though. Here&rsquo;s the source for it, again.</p>

<pre><code class="language-clojure">(defn update-title [data record]
  (map #(if (= (:id record) (:id %))
          (assoc % :title (:title record))
          %) data))

;; called with
;; (swap! links update-title record)
</code></pre>

<p>The function loops over the list of links, which are represented as hashmaps. If the <code>id</code> of the current item is equal to the one we want to update, we update the <code>title</code> value. If not, we keep just copy the link map into the new data set. I admit, this is a lot of rigmarole, but again, it&rsquo;s fun to try not use a database as a crutch. Once I do commit to having a database, this code will likely go away.</p>

<h2 id="integrating-the-new-way">Integrating the new way</h2>

<p>Now that there&rsquo;s a way for me to update the atom, I need to integrate that into the flow of a web request.</p>

<pre><code class="language-clojure">(GET &quot;/&quot; []
  (async-get-title)
  (update-atom)
  (views/index))

(POST &quot;/api/links&quot; request
  (let [next-id (inc (apply max (map #(:id %) @links)))
        new-link (:body request)
        new-link-with-fields (assoc new-link :id next-id :title (:url new-link) :created_at &quot;2015-12-15&quot;)]
    (async-request-title new-link-with-fields)
    (swap! links conj new-link-with-fields)
    (json/write-str @links)))
</code></pre>

<p>When I load the view, I call the 2 background functions, so that <code>go</code> blocks are set up. The <code>go</code> blocks are where putting and taking from channels are executed. These functions will wait for new input to come in, but since I am not interested in the return value, calling them returns immediately.</p>

<p>The code that creates a link is changed, as well. Firstly, the synchronous fetch is reverted back to what I had initially, where <code>title</code> is the URL. Then, just before adding the new link, a request is submitted for the title attribute of the URL. This kicks off the asynchronous pipeline.</p>

<h2 id="incoming-gif">Incoming GIF!</h2>

<p>This is how this looks now.</p>

<p><img src="/images/core-async-magic.gif" alt="core async magic" /></p>

<p>The speed of update is back, since we&rsquo;re just pre-pending a record to an in-memory data structure. After a reload (or 2), the title is changed, demonstrating the background work.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s about it for now. Until the next post.</p>
